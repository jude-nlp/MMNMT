The Creature in the Shop
My name is Dr Frederick Treves . I am a doctor at the London Hospital .
One day in 1884 , I saw a picture in the window of a shop near the hospital .
I stopped in front of the shop and looked at the picture .
At first I felt interested , then I felt angry , then afraid .
There was a man in the picture , but he did not look like you and me .
He did not look like a man . He looked like an elephant .
I read the writing under the picture . It said : Come in and see the Elephant Man . 2 pence .
I opened the door and went in .
There was a man in the shop . He was a dirty man in an old coat with a cigarette in his mouth .
